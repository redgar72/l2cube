  <p>Cube rotations (x, y, z)</p>
  <p>
    The x rotation follows the same direction as the r move (right face), rotating the entire cube around the x-axis.
    The y rotation follows the same direction as the u move (up face), rotating the entire cube around the y-axis.
    The z rotation follows the same direction as the f move (front face), rotating the entire cube around the z-axis.
